It seems to me I have done it :) 

Things I like:
* I had some dirty hacks in my pocket like database connector and base test class
* I have spent plenty of time finding exploring the whole framework - there are nice points for dependency injections, 
which are quite comfortable to use while testing
* Testing framework pytest-sanic is handy, but a there are some issues with pytest-asyncio collaborations:)

Things I did not like:
* docker-compose is not working correctly on my pc because of any networking issues OR I have wrong connection way
in services - they cannot connect the database while running in containers:(( But they are working nice while running 
locally
* I do not like sanic-openapi - comparing with FastAPI features it provides not so powerful tool as I wish.
* Serialization models could possibly be used together with Swagger models, but I had no motivation to do that by
my own, so it looks weird))
* Overall, I do not really like sanic - FastAPI provides more useful features just out of the box.

Anyway, it made me more experienced:)
